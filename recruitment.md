I'm looking forward for self-motivated students to work together.
As a member of [Cyber-Physical Computing Laboratory](https://cpc.ait.kyushu-u.ac.jp/), we have the wide scope of interests in computer system architecture field.

## Undergraduate students

I'm looking for motivated bachelor students interested in designing future computer system architecture, including classical computers such as microprocessors, memory subsystems, and IoT systems, and quantum computers such as Noisy Intermediate-Scale Computers (NISQ) and Fault-Tolerant Qnautum Computers (FTQC).
My research topics are the best suited for students in CM and CE courses of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS).
Students in EE course can also choose our research group.

## Research students

We accept motivated research students who plan to continue research in Doctoral Program.
If you are interested in computer system architecture research, send me an e-mail with your CV and __your brief research plan__.
Check [here](https://www.isee.kyushu-u.ac.jp/e/research_student.html) for more information.
Through an online interview, I will accept if your background and interests match excellently with our research group.

## Master's program

I'm looking for motivated Master's program students.
If you are interested in computer system architecture research, send me an e-mail with your CV and __your brief research plan__ before applying for the entrance examination.
